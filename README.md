# C11-threading-examples

The C language didn't have multi-threading features until C11. Since C11, the language itself has a multi-threading support.

The threading APIs are almost identical to POSIX threads except some minor improvements and slightly different API names.

This repository contains a set of (minimal) examples for all C11 APIs.
